# --- Directory Paths ---

# Source directory (e.g., mounted network volume) where .livework folders are located
# SOURCE_DIR="/Volumes/Colour/#Colour Work/2025"
SOURCE_DIR="<path_to_source_directory>"

# Local directory to sync to
# LOCAL_DIR=/Users/john/Live_Work
LOCAL_DIR="<path_to_local_directory>"

# --- Sync Behavior ---
# How often TurboSync checks for new/removed .livework folders (in minutes)

# Sync interval in minutes
# SYNC_INTERVAL=5
SYNC_INTERVAL=5

# Watch local files for changes
# WATCH_LOCAL_FILES=true

# WATCH_DELAY_SECONDS=2

# --- Syncthing Instance Configuration ---
# TurboSync manages two local Syncthing instances.
# Ensure API addresses and GUI addresses use different ports if running simultaneously.

# Configuration for the Syncthing instance handling the SOURCE directory
# SYNCTHING_API_ADDRESS_SOURCE="127.0.0.1:28384" # REST API address
SYNCTHING_API_ADDRESS_SOURCE="127.0.0.1:28384"
# SYNCTHING_GUI_ADDRESS_SOURCE="127.0.0.1:28385" # Web GUI address (optional, must differ from DEST)
SYNCTHING_GUI_ADDRESS_SOURCE="127.0.0.1:28385"

# Configuration for the Syncthing instance handling the LOCAL (Destination) directory
# SYNCTHING_API_ADDRESS_DEST="127.0.0.1:28386" # REST API address (must differ from SOURCE)
SYNCTHING_API_ADDRESS_DEST="127.0.0.1:28386"
# SYNCTHING_GUI_ADDRESS_DEST="127.0.0.1:28387" # Web GUI address (optional, must differ from SOURCE)
SYNCTHING_GUI_ADDRESS_DEST="127.0.0.1:28387"

# --- Application Behavior ---
